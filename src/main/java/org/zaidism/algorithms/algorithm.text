Bubble Sort algorithm step by step, showing the state of the array after each iteration:

Explanation of Iterations:

1. Initial array: 3, 1, 5, 4, 2
   Iteration 1: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
   In the first iteration, the largest unsorted element "5" is moved to its correct position at the end of the array.

2. Second iteration:
   Iteration 2: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
   The next largest unsorted element "4" is moved to its correct position.

3. Third iteration:
   Iteration 3: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   The array is now partially sorted, and the largest unsorted element "3" is moved to its correct position.

4. Fourth iteration:
   Iteration 4: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   The array is already sorted at this point, and no swaps occur in this iteration. The algorithm recognizes this and breaks out of the loop.

Final Result:
The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is the sorted result after the Bubble Sort algorithm completes its iterations.
