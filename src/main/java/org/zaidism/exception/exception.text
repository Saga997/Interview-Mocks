Practical use of finally block

    - Finally can be practically used in a code where we create connection to db and then perform insert/update/delete and if any exception occurs then it should go to catch
    block and after that we always want to close the db connection that code can be implemented inside finally block.

    - System.exit can stop finally block execution.
