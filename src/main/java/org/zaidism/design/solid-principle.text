1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

Example:
Suppose we have a class `Employee` that manages employee data and also handles email notifications. This violates the SRP because it has two responsibilities: managing data
and sending notifications.
