The most commonly used methods in a REST API are,
PUT- The PUT method updates the resources that are already available on the web server. The PUT method replaces
everything at the target URL with the provided resource. The PUT method can be used to make a new resource or update an existing one.
GET - to retrieve data or resources from a server. The server is instructed to fetch and return the requested resource,
often in the form of an HTTP response, when a client sends a GET request to a particular URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
 GET requests are safe and idempotent, they shouldn't have any negative impacts on the server or the resource being accessed.

DELETE

POST-to create or submit data to a server. The server is told to process and save the data contained in the request
body when a client sends a POST request to a certain URI.

PUT- The PUT method updates the resources that are already available on the web server. The PUT method replaces
everything at the target URL with the provided resource. used to make a new resource or update an existing one

PUT-Replaces the entire resource with a new representation, sending all the fields of the resource in the request body,
even if they are not modified.example, a client might send a PUT request to update a user account with a new email address.
PATCH-Applies partial updates to a resource, sending only the fields that need to be changed in the request body.
client might use PATCH to update a customer's city. PATCH can save bandwidth because it transfers less data than
sending the entire record with PUT
