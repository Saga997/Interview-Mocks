Problems:

public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String recipient, String content) {
        // Code to send email
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + recipient);
    }
}

public class PasswordResetService {
    private EmailService emailService;

    public PasswordResetService() {
        this.emailService = new EmailService(); // Direct dependency on a specific implementation
    }

    public void resetPassword(String userEmail) {
        // Code to reset password
        emailService.sendEmail(userEmail, "Your password has been reset.");
    }
}

Tight Coupling: PasswordResetService is tightly coupled to EmailService. If you need to change
the way emails are sent (e.g., using an SMS service or a different email provider), you'll
have to modify the PasswordResetService class.
Difficulty in Testing: Testing PasswordResetService in isolation is difficult because it directly
depends on EmailService.
