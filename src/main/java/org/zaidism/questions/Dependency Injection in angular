1. Injector
The injector is the mechanism that figures out how to create and supply the dependencies.
Angularâ€™s dependency injector is responsible for creating service instances and injecting them into components or
other services.

2. Provider
A provider is a way to tell the Angular injector how to create a dependency. Every service you want to
inject needs to have a provider.
Providers tell Angular how to obtain or create a service.

3. Token
A token is a way to uniquely identify a dependency. For services, Angular uses the class as the token.

4. Service
A service is a class that provides reusable functionality that can be shared across components.
Angular creates services via the DI system, so services can be injected into other services or components.
